#Sample project
###by Sheyna Watkins

This is a basic front page for a site created mostly from scratch in HTML and whitespace Sass. The site uses some JavaScript obtained from other sources (see credit on each file). The site is responsive.

The type is a little small so I may go back and change a few things. I did not create this design.
